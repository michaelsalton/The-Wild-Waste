Features explained

  Weather effects

 - The game includes a couple different types of dust storms as well as tumbleweeds. These effects appear randomly as the player explores the map.

	Collectible loot

- The player can find loot boxes throughout the map. When the user interacts with the loot boxes a random amount of coins will fly out of the box with an animation and then fly towards the player where they are. The loot will add up and go towards the players score.

	Loot review menu system

- At the end of each in-game night, the player will be able to review how much loot they collected that night before proceeding to the next night.

	Procedurally generated map

- The spawn area of the map is hand made. Outside of the spawn area all the buildings, landmarks, and other points of interest and randomly spawned in when the game is started. This allows for a brand new map each time the game is played for more replay-ability, and a more unique experience.

	Footprint system

- As the player explores the map they will leave behind footprints. These footprints, as well as being a great effect for increased immersion, allow the player to be able to retrace their steps if needed, which plays into a huge aspect of the game and is very helpful during gameplay.

	Tutorial mode

- The game includes a sort of built in tutorial mode that is made to be hidden to the player. During the first night an NPC in the game will popup and give the player hints about playing. On top of that, the first night shields the player from any real challenge and lets them get the hang out things before maki
